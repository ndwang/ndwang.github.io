Iâ€™m a graduate researcher in accelerator physics, currently focused on space charge simulation and optimization for the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). My research centers on understanding how intense charged particle beams evolve under collective interactions. I've developed and applied space charge simulation models to study beam dynamics in the EIC Strong Hadron Cooler (SHC) and Low Energy Cooler (LEC), where intense, low-emittance electron beams are essential for achieving efficient hadron cooling.
